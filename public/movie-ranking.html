<h3>1. Batman: The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>I have watched this movie multiple times. Heath Ledgers acting as the joker is
    an all time great and its what makes me love this movie.
</p>
<h3>2. The Lion King</h3>
<p>I love this movie since I was a kid. It still gets me in tears after all these
    years.
</p>
<h3>3. Spider Man: No Way Home</h3>
<p>Spider Man has been my favorite superheroe since I was a kid. This movie was great
    as it brought together all of the Spider Men from different movies.
